# Sub-G-Shield
This is the source code to a senior design project done by Alexander Beck and Christopher Baldwin. This project creates the backbone for a spi slave CC1310 which communicates with an Arudino. The shield is able to send and receive RF signals over TI's Sub-Gigahertz protocol and transmit that data to and from the Arduino.
